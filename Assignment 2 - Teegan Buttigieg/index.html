                    <p>It was 1989</p>
                    <p>My thoughts were short, my hair was long</p>
                    <p>Caught somewhere between a boy and man</p>
                    <p>She was 17</p>
                    <p>And she was far from in-between</p>
                    <p>It was summertime in northern Michigan</p>
                </div>

                <div class="verse1">
                    <p>Splashing through the sandbar</p>
                    <p>Talking by the campfire</p>
                    <p>It's the simple things in life like when and where</p>
                    <p>We didn't have no internet</p>
                    <p>But man, I never will forget</p>
                    <p>The way the moonlight shined upon her hair</p>

                    <p>Making love out by the lake to our favorite song</p>
                    <p>Sipping whiskey out the bottle</p>
                    <p>Not thinking 'bout tomorrow</p>
                    <p>Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long</p>

                    <p>She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul</p>
                    <p>We'd blister in the sun</p>
                    <p>We couldn't wait for night to come</p>
                    <p>To hit that sand and play some rock 'n' roll</p>

                    <p>Or how we thought those days would never end</p>
                    <p>Sometimes I hear that song</p>
                    <p>And I start to sing along</p>
